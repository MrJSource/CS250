Software Development Lifecycle 
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
user stories are a crucial tool for interpreting and implementing user needs. By describing features or functionalities from the user's perspective, the development team gains a deeper understanding of what the user wants and why. User stories also help the team prioritize tasks and focus on delivering value to the user. Continuously testing and validating user stories throughout development ensures that the final product meets the user's needs.
•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Program development should begin by understanding the needs and goals of the user and planning accordingly. A popular approach to program development is Agile Development, which emphasizes incremental development, collaboration, and communication with stakeholders. To incorporate Agile processes into your work, consider using user-centered design, the Scrum framework, continuous integration and delivery, Kanban, and regular retrospectives. These practices prioritize user needs while enabling efficient and effective team collaboration.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development should possess effective communication skills, work collaboratively with others, take responsibility for their work, adapt to changing requirements, and exhibit a strong work ethic to ensure quality deliverables.
